## Minimum Viable Product

### Basics

- **Real Value from the first time:** It's very important that the product
  offers real value from the first time,
  otherwise it won't get the customer interest. If we only provide a regular
  CMS or even a mobile app, the customer don't see any value and won't want
  to buy it.

  The website/mobile app need to provide value, for example: be able to
  concrete a sale of a product, help to provide customer support, enable
  customer contact, allow the customer discovery, etc. it needs to be
  something that the customer see as real value for their business.

- **Easy to use, easy to succeed:** If the customer has to struggle with
  the use of the app, they will not invest a big time or effort, they will
  start looking at somewhere else.
  
  If they see that it's easy for them to perform actions that turn into
  value for their business, they will have a positive strong feeling about
  the product.

- **Scalable:** Whatever we offer to the customer, it needs to be scalable,
  otherwise we will become their bottleneck and thus they will need to fix
  it by removing us or looking for an alternative that is not us.

- **Pricing schema:** Usually an early startup don't have the enough money
  to create an in-house app or pay an external engineer. As the nature
  of this kind of project would mean a high cost, it's very important that we
  keep it simple and lean.
  
  Selling an expensive solution to them is more difficult, so the ideal solution will be the one
  that offers
  a free service or trial so that they get value from the begining.
  Ideally, they should be
  able to get value from a free service so that they will eventually get
  convinced to pay for the premium features if they're not conviced from the
  begining.

  We need to be carefull as the decrease of the pricing will be perceived as
  a service that lacks of value.

  The price schema should follow the same as Digital Ocean does compared to
  AWS, offering a flat price for a good product.

- **Open Source**: We aim to offer a product that is open so that the
  community can get benefit of what we develop and at the same time we
  boost our development with their contributions and viceverza.

  Initially we will open basic and independant components to reduce noice
  that could distract us from our customer in the whole MVP.
